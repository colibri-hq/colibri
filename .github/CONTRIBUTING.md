# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be credited in the release notes. Please keep in mind that this is a
community-driven project, and we are all volunteers. We will do our best to review your contributions
in a timely manner, but please be patient.

## Pull Requests
We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/colibri-hq/colibri).

Here are some guidelines to make the process smoother:

- **Add tests**—New features and bugfixes need tests. If you find it difficult to test, please tell us in the pull
  request and we will try to help you!
- **Document any change in behaviour**—Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept
  up-to-date.
- **Run `pnpm test` locally**—This will allow you to go faster.
- **One pull request per feature**—If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history**—Make sure your commits message means something.
- **Consider our release cycle**—We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs
  is not an option.

## Creating issues

### Bug reports

Always try to provide as much information as possible. If you are reporting a bug, try to provide a reproduction 
repository (or anything else) or a stacktrace at the very least. This will help us understand the problem quicker.

### Feature requests

Lay out the reasoning behind it and propose an API for it. Ideally, you should have a practical example to prove the
utility of the feature you're requesting.
