# Collections

Collections help you organize your library into custom reading lists, categories, and curated sets. Create collections for any purpose: to-read lists, favorites, genre categories, themed reading challenges, or book club selections.

## What are Collections?

Collections are flexible, user-defined groups of books that you can customize, share, and organize however you like.

**Use cases:**

- **Reading lists**: "Summer 2024 Reading", "Books to Read Before 30"
- **Genre organization**: "Science Fiction", "Mystery & Thriller", "Historical Fiction"
- **Personal categories**: "Favorites", "Comfort Reads", "Books I Own Physically"
- **Thematic sets**: "Books About AI", "Feminist Literature", "Climate Fiction"
- **Book clubs**: Share curated lists with your reading group
- **Gift recommendations**: "Gift Ideas for Mom", "Best Books for Teens"

- **Brain Candy**: Light, fun, easy reads
- **Deep Thinkers**: Philosophy, dense literary fiction
- **Page Turners**: Can't-put-down suspense
- **Mood Lifters**: Uplifting, positive stories

### By Format or Source

Track where books came from:

- **Library Books**: Borrowed from public library
- **Kindle Books**: Digital purchases
- **Physical Books I Own**: Your personal shelf

- **ARCs**: Advanced review copies

### By Relationship

Social and collaborative collections:

## Sharing Collections

Share your curated lists with others on your instance.

### Making a Collection Shareable

1. Edit the collection
2. Set visibility to **Public**
3. _Optional:_ Add a detailed description explaining the collection's theme
4. _Optional:_ Write notes about why you chose each book
5. Save changes

The collection now appears in:

- Search results when users search for collection names

### Collection URLs

Every public collection has a permanent URL:

```
https://your-instance.com/collections/[collection-id]/[collection-name]
```

Share this URL with anyone on your instance to give them direct access.

### Collaborative Collections

**Note:** Direct collaboration (multiple editors) is not currently supported. However, you can:

1. Create a collection and make it public
2. Share the URL with collaborators
3. Collaborators can create their own copy by:
   - Viewing your collection
   - Creating a new collection
   - Adding the same books manually

**Coming soon:** True collaborative collections with multiple editors.

## Best Practices

### Naming Collections

**Good names:**

- Clear and descriptive: "Science Fiction Classics"
- Specific to purpose: "Book Club 2024"
- Actionable: "To Read This Summer"

**Avoid:**

- Generic names: "Books", "Collection 1"
- Overlapping names: "Favorites" and "Best Books" (merge them)
- Too specific: "Books I Read on Tuesday in March" (use tags instead)

### Organization Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with major categories (Fiction, Non-Fiction), then create subcollections as your library grows

2. **Limit active collections**: Too many collections create decision fatigue. Aim for 5-10 actively used collections

3. **Archive completed collections**: Move old reading challenge collections to Private once completed

4. **Use consistent icons**: Pick an icon system and stick with it (e.g., 📕 for fiction, 📘 for non-fiction)

5. **Regular maintenance**: Review collections monthly, remove books you're not interested in anymore

### Collection Hygiene

- **Remove duplicates**: Books should be in collections where they truly belong
- **Update descriptions**: Keep collection descriptions current
- **Prune inactive collections**: Delete collections you no longer use
- **Merge similar collections**: Combine "Want to Read" and "To Read" into one

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up collection management with shortcuts:

| Shortcut               | Action                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `C`                    | Add current work to collection              |
| `N`                    | Create new collection (on Collections page) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter`     | Save collection changes                     |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Remove book from collection (when hovering) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + A`         | Select all books in collection              |
| `Escape`               | Close collection modal                      |

## Troubleshooting

### Book Not Appearing in Collection

**Problem:** Added a book to a collection, but it doesn't show up

**Solutions:**

1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Check the collection's sort order (custom order might place it out of view)
3. Verify the book was actually added (check confirmation message)
4. Check filters if any are applied to the collection view

### Cannot Delete Collection

**Problem:** Delete button is disabled or missing

**Causes:**

- You're not the collection owner (can't delete others' collections)
- Collection is marked as system-generated (protected)

**Solutions:**

- Verify you created the collection
- Contact instance administrator if it's a system collection

### Collection Not Visible to Others

**Problem:** Made collection public, but others can't see it

**Causes:**

- Instance has public collections disabled
- You're testing with your own account (you always see your collections)
- Collection is actually still set to Private

**Solutions:**

- Verify **Visibility** is set to **Public** in Edit menu
- Check instance settings for public collection support
- Ask another user to verify they can see it

### Books Disappeared from Collection

**Problem:** Books missing from a collection unexpectedly

**Causes:**

- Books were removed (check collection history)
- Sort order changed and books are out of view
- Filters applied that hide certain books

**Solutions:**

- Scroll through entire collection to verify books are gone
- Check sort order and filters
- Check collection activity log for removal events
