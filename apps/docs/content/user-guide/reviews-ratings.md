Reviews and ratings are planned for a future release. This page describes the intended functionality.

## Rating Books

Colibri will support rating books on a 5-star scale:

- Rate any book from your work detail page
- Your ratings are saved automatically
- View your ratings in the library grid and on work pages

## Personal Notes

In addition to ratings, you'll be able to add personal notes to books in your library for your own reference.
