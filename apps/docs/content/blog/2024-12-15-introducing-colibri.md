Colibri is a self-hosted ebook library application built for readers who value privacy and control over their digital book collections.

## What is Colibri?

Colibri provides a modern web interface for managing your personal ebook library. Upload EPUB, MOBI, and PDF files, and Colibri automatically extracts metadata, cover images, and organizes your collection.

### Key Features

**Metadata Enrichment**: Connect to authoritative sources like Open Library, WikiData, and the Library of Congress to automatically enrich your books with professional-grade bibliographic information.

**Passwordless Authentication**: Secure your library with Passkeys (WebAuthn) instead of traditional passwords.

**Flexible Organization**: Create collections, track series, and tag books however you prefer.

**Self-Hosted**: Your data stays on your infrastructure. No tracking, no cloud dependencies, complete privacy.

**Command-Line Tools**: A full-featured CLI for automation, bulk imports, and scripting.
