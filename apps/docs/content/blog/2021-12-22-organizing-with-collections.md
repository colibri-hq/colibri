If you've got more than a handful of books, you need a good organization system. That's where Colibri's collections come
in.

## What Are Collections?

Collections are flexible groups for organizing your books. Unlike rigid folder structures, a book can belong to multiple
collections:

- 📚 **To Read** - Your reading backlog
- ⭐ **Favorites** - The best of the best
- 🎓 **Work Books** - Professional development
- 🏖️ **Beach Reads** - Light summer reading

## Creating Your First Collection

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar
2. Enter a name for your collection
3. Choose an icon (emoji or custom)
4. Click **Create**

That's it! Your collection is ready to use.

## Adding Books to Collections

There are several ways to add books:

### Drag and Drop

Simply drag a book cover onto a collection in the sidebar.

### Right-Click Menu

1. Right-click on a book
2. Select **Add to Collection**
3. Choose your collection(s)

### Bulk Selection

1. Hold `Shift` and click to select multiple books
2. Click the collection icon in the toolbar
3. Choose your destination

## Smart Collections

Smart collections automatically populate based on rules:

```
Name: "Recent Reads"
Rules:
  - Last read: Within 30 days
  - Progress: Greater than 50%
```

### Available Filters

| Filter     | Options                |
|------------|------------------------|
| Author     | is, contains           |
| Tag        | is, is not             |
| Date added | within, before, after  |
| Progress   | any, started, finished |
| Rating     | equals, at least       |
| Format     | epub, mobi, pdf        |

## Nesting Collections

Create hierarchies with subcollections:

```
📖 Fiction
  ├── 🔮 Fantasy
  │   ├── Epic Fantasy
  │   └── Urban Fantasy
  ├── 🚀 Sci-Fi
  └── 🔍 Mystery
```

To create a subcollection, drag one collection onto another.

## Custom Icons

Make collections visually distinct:

1. Click the collection icon
2. Choose from:
    - **Emoji** - Quick and expressive
    - **Icon library** - Clean, consistent icons
    - **Custom image** - Upload your own

## Tips and Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `C` - Create new collection
- `1-9` - Jump to collection by number
- `Shift+Click` - Multi-select books

1. Right-click a collection
2. Select **Change Color**
3. Pick from the palette
