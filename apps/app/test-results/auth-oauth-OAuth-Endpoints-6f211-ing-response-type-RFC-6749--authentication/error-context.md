            - paragraph [ref=e10]: The integration you're trying to connect to Colibri had an error and couldn't connect to your account properly. To prevent unauthorized access to your data, Colibri has denied the connection.
            - paragraph [ref=e11]: The reason for this error may be temporary issues, an outdated integration, or simply a bug in its code; in some cases, though, this may also hint at a malicious application or someone trying to do something more nefarious.
            - paragraph [ref=e12]: If the problems persist, try to contact the integration author or the Colibri development team, and be careful.
